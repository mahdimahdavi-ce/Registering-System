# Registering-System
This is the final project of Internet Engineering course at SBU. In this project, I had the chance to implement a real-world system that
intended to simulate the registration system at the universities, Even though this project doesn't have the full functionality of a real system, it
has almost all the necessary ones. Some of the technologies that I've used are:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Typescript
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Redis
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Swagger
